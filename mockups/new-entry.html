But the afternoon was better. Had lunch with Maya and we talked through some of the issues. She helped me see that maybe I'm being too hard on myself. The client's expectations were probably unrealistic anyway.

Got some good coding done in the evening, which always helps me decompress. Still feeling stressed about tomorrow's deadline though.</textarea>
